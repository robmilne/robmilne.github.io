    <h1>GitHub Pages</h1>
    After spending way more hours than I wanted too on this I have come to the conclusion
that GitHub pages is not what I was looking for.  Yes it is a good way to present openly
available content but I see it as little more that an open-source project readme with
navigation. The source (a GitHub repository) cannot be made private in the GitHub settings
if it is to be viewable on a browser.
