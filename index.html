    <h1>GitHub Pages</h1>
    <p>I spent way more hours than I wanted to investigating GitHub pages as a
free website alternative. I came to the conclusion that it is not what I was
looking for.<p>
    <p>The Jekyll static website is a nice way to present themed content on a
browser but I see it's usefulness as little more that an open-source project
readme.md with navigation. Having a personal website repository that exposes
every commit to public scrutiny isn't my idea of how a personal website should
be managed.<br>The source (a GitHub repository) <b>cannot</b> be made private
in the repository settings and remain viewable on a browser.</p>
