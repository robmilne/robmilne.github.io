    <h1>GitHub Pages</h1>
    <p>After spending way more hours than I wanted too on this I have come to the conclusion
that GitHub pages is not what I was looking for.<br>It is a good way to present openly
available content but I see it as little more that an open-source project readme.md with
navigation.<br>The source (a GitHub repository) cannot be made private in the GitHub settings
if it is to be viewable on a browser.</p>
